# `Categorical Naive Bayes` using Scikit-Learn

`Categorical Naive Bayes` is a supervised machine learning algorithm which has been used for a classification task in this example. It is suitable for classification with categorical features. It assumes that each feature has its own categorical distribution.

I used `adult.csv` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. The task is to predict whether a person's income exceeds __$50K__ or not! Some columns of this dataset contain null values and some have numerical features. I dropped them before training the model.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

### The full code is available in `Categorical_NB.ipynb` file.

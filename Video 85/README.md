# `Isolation Forest` using Scikit-Learn

The purpose of using the Isolation Forest algorithm in Scikit-learn is to perform anomaly detection, which involves identifying rare or unusual data points that deviate significantly from the majority of observations. The algorithm is based on the principle that anomalies are few and different, making them easier to isolate through random partitioning.

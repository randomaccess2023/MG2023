# `Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)` using Scikit-Learn

`Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)` is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is very similar to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) except the assumption that the classes share the same covariance matrix, i.e., each class has its own covariance matrix. In this case, the boundary between classes is a quadratic surface instead of a hyperplane.

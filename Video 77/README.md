# `Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)` using Scikit-Learn

`Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)` is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is very similar to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) except the assumption that the classes share the same covariance matrix. In other words, each class has its own covariance matrix. In this case, the boundary between classes is a quadratic surface instead of a hyperplane. 

I used `raisin.xlsx` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 2 types of raisins: __Kecimen & Besni__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

### The full code is available at `QDA.ipynb` file.

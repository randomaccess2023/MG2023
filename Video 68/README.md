# `Logistic Regression` using Scikit-Learn

`Logistic Regression` is a supervised machine learning algorithm. Despite the name, it can be used for a classification task. In this model, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes of a single trial are modeled using a _logistic function_.

I used `rice.csv` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 2 types of Turkish rice: __Cammeo & Osmancik__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

### The full code is available in `Logistic_Regression.ipynb` file.

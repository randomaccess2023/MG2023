# Machine Learning: `CatBoost Classifier` using Python API

Categorical Boosting (`CatBoost`) is a gradient-boosting algorithm for machine learning. Gradient boosting is a process in which many decision trees are constructed iteratively. In CatBoost, each successive tree is built with reduced loss compared to the previous trees.

I used `mushrooms.csv` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 2 types of mushrooms in the target column: __edible & poisonous__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

This is the plot of feature importance:

### The full code is available in `CatBoost_Classifier.ipynb` file.

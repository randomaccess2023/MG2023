# `Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)` using Scikit-Learn

`Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)` is a supervised machine learning algorithm. This approach is used in machine learning to solve classification problems with two or more classes. __LDA__ fits a Gaussian density to each class, assuming all classes share the same covariance matrix.

I used `raisin.xlsx` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 2 types of raisins: __Kecimen & Besni__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

### The full code is available in `LDA.ipynb` file.

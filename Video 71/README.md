# Machine Learning: `XGBoost Classifier` using Python API

eXtreme Gradient Boosting (`XGBoost`) is a gradient-boosting algorithm for machine learning. __XGBoost__ builds a predictive model by combining the predictions of multiple individual models, often decision trees, in an iterative manner.

I used `banknote_authetication.csv` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 2 types of entities in the target column: __0 & 1__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

This is the plot of feature importance:

### The full code is available in `XGBoost_Classifier.ipynb` file.

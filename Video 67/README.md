# `Complement Naive Bayes` using Scikit-Learn

`Complement Naive Bayes` is a supervised machine learning algorithm which has been used for a classification task in this example. This algorithm is a modification of `Multinomial Naive Bayes` and it works well in the case of unbalanced datasets.

I used `ham_spam.csv` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 2 types of emails: __ham & spam__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

### The full code is available in `ComplementNB.ipynb` file.

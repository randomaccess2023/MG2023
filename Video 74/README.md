# `Artificial Neural Network (ANN)` for regression task using PyTorch

A regression analysis in machine learning is used to investigate the relationship between one or more independent variables (treated as _features_) and a dependent variable (regarded as _outcome_). It is a method for predictive modelling and is used to predict a continuous outcome.

I used _sklearn's_ __california housing__ dataset for this example. This dataset has 8 features and I built a very simple artificial neural network model using PyTorch to carry out a regression analysis.

The model loss looks like this after 100 epochs:

The model prediction looks like this:

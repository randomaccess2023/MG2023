# `Bagging Classifier` using Scikit-Learn

__Bagging__ is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is an ensemble learning technique in which multiple base estimators are trained independently and in parallel on different subsets of the training data. The final prediction is made by aggregating all the predictions of the base estimators.

I used `glass_identification.csv` dataset in this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It has 6 unique types of glass along with 9 features.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

### The full code is available in `Bagging_Classifier.ipynb` file.

# `Gaussian Naive Bayes` using Scikit-Learn

`Gaussian Naive Bayes` is a supervised machine learning algorithm which has been used for a classification task in this example. This algorithm assumes that each feature in the dataset follows a Gaussian distribution.

I used sklearn's `breast cancer` dataset for this example. It contains 30 features and 2 types of cancers: __malignant & benign__. This dataset is also known as the __Breast Cancer Wisconsin__ dataset.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

### The full code is available in `GaussianNB.ipynb` file.

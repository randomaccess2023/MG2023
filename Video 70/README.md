# Machine Learning: `LightGBM Classifier` using Python API

Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (`LightGBM`) is a gradient-boosting algorithm for machine learning. It uses a histogram-based method in which data is bucketed into bins using a histogram of the distribution.

I used `magic_gamma_telescope.csv` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 2 types of entities in the target column: __g=gamma(signal) & h=hadron(background)__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

This is the plot of feature importance:

### The full code is available in `LightGBM_Classifier.ipynb` file.

# `AdaBoost Classifier` using Scikit-Learn

`AdaBoost Classifier` is a supervised machine learning algorithm. AdaBoost is short for __Adaptive Boosting__ and is used as an ensemble method in machine learning. The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data.

I used `dry_bean.xlsx` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 7 types of beans: __SEKER, BARBUNYA, BOMBAY, CALI, HOROZ, SIRA & DERMASON__.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

This is the plot of feature importance:

### The full code is available in `AdaBoost_Classifier.ipynb` file.

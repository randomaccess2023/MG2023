# Feature to image representation using Matplotlib

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique which allows us to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.

I used sklearn's __digits__ dataset for this example which contains images of 0 to 9 having a resolution of __8x8__ pixels. I selected 5 samples of each digit. I applied t-SNE to their features and reduced their dimensionality from 64 to 2. Then, I visualized the reduced features in a 2D plot. I also replaced these features with their corresponding images in another 2D plot.

This is how these plots look like:

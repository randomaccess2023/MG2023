# `Bernoulli Naive Bayes` using Scikit-Learn

`Bernoulli Naive Bayes` is a supervised machine learning algorithm which has been used for a classification task in this example. It is suitable for classification with binary features, i.e., each feature is assumed to be a binary/boolean variable.

I used `zoo.csv` dataset for this example. The dataset is available in the repository. It contains 16 features for 7 types of animals. Out of these 16 features, 15 are binary. They along with the targets have been used to train the __Bernoulli Naive Bayes__ model.

I obtained the following confusion matrix:

### The full code is available in `BernoulliNB.ipynb` file.
